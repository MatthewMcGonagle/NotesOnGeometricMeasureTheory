\title{Notes on Geometric Measure Theory}
\author{Matthew McGonagle}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
The purpose of these notes is mostly to expand discussions or explain details of arguments
in Federer's Geometric Measure Theory. So the layout of these notes will reflect the relevant location
of the topic from Federer.

Note that we also use Federer's definition of a measure, which in standard treatments would be called
an outer measure.
