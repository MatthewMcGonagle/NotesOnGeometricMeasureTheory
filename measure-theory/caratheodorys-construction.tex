\subsection{An Identity for the Upper Integral based on Caratheodory's Construction (Federer 2.10.24 (1))} 
Federer shows that the quantity \(\lambda_\delta(f)\) based on Caratheodory's construction matches the upper
Lebesgue Integral \(\int^* f d\psi\) in certain cases. We will prove the following
statement from the case of (Federer 2.10.24 (1)),
\begin{proposition}
In the case of (Federer 2.10.24 (1)), there exists an increasing sequence of
Borel sets \(B_i\) and a sequence of \(\epsilon_i > 0\) such that
\begin{equation}
\psi\left(\{x \mid f(x) > 0 \} \setminus \bigcup_i B_i \right) = 0,
\end{equation}
and \(\psi(B_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S)\) whenever \(S \in F\), \(B_i \cap S \neq \emptyset\),
and \(\text{diam }S \leq \epsilon_i\).
\end{proposition}

Now we prove the proposition.
\begin{proof}
It is clear that we may write \(\{x \mid f(x) > 0\} = \bigcup_j A_j\) for an increasing sequence of sets
\(A_j\) with \(\psi(A_j) < \infty\). Given \(i\),  consider the set of
\(C_{ij} = \{x \mid \psi(A_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S) \text{ for } x \in S
    \text{ and diam } S \leq 1/j\}\). Note that \(C_{ij}\) is increasing in \(j\) and that 
\(\psi\left( A_i \setminus \bigcup_{j} C_{ij} \right) = 0\) by (Federer 2.10.18 (3)). Therefore, we may
find a set \(\tilde C_i\) and \(\epsilon_i > 0\) such that for all \(x \in \tilde C_i\) we have that
\(\psi(A_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S)\)
whenever \(x \in S\) and \(\text{diam } S < \epsilon_i\)
; furthermore \(\psi(A_i \setminus \tilde C_i) \leq 2^{-i - 1}\). In particular,
\(\psi(\tilde C_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S)\) whenever \(S \cap \tilde C_i \neq \emptyset\) and
\(\text{diam } S \leq \epsilon_i\).

From the Borel regularity of \(\psi\) we may find Borel sets \(B_i\) such that \(\tilde C_i \subset B_i\) and
\(\psi(B_i) = \psi(\tilde C_i)\); note that \(B_i\) must then be a \(\psi\)-hull of \(\tilde C_i\).
In particular, since
each \(S \in F\) is closed and hence \(\psi\) measurable, we have that 
\(\psi(B_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S)\) whenever \(S \cap \tilde C_i \neq \emptyset\) and
\(\text{ diam } S \leq \epsilon_i\). Since each \(S \in F\) is measurable (since closed) and
\(B_i\) is a \(\psi\)-hull of \(\tilde C_i\), we have that \(\psi(B_i \cap S) = \psi(\tilde C_i \cap S)\) for all
\(S \in F\). Furthermore, if \(S \cap B_i \neq \emptyset\) but
\(S \cap \tilde C_i = \emptyset\), then \(\psi(B_i \cap S) = 0\). So we we have
that \(\psi(B_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S)\) whenever \(S \cap B_i \neq \emptyset\) and
\(\text{ diam } S \leq \epsilon_i\).

To form an increasing sequence of Borel sets, we set \(\tilde B_i = \bigcap_{j \geq i} B_j\). We see that
\(\psi(A_i \setminus \tilde B_i) \leq \sum_{j \geq i} \psi(A_i \setminus B_j) \leq 2^{-i}\). Furthermore,
since \(\tilde B_i \subset B_i\), we have that \(\psi(\tilde B_i \cap S) \leq (1 + i^{-1}) \zeta(S)\) whenever
\(S \cap \tilde B_i \neq \emptyset\) and
\(\text{ diam } S \leq \epsilon_i\).

Next, note that \(\psi\left(A_i \setminus \bigcup_j \tilde B_j\right) \leq \psi(A_i \setminus \tilde B_j) \leq
2^{-j}\)
for any \(j \geq i\) (recall that \(A_i\) is increasing). Therefore,
\(\psi\left(A_i \setminus \bigcup_j \tilde B_j\right) = 0\), and we get that
\(\psi\left( \{ x \mid f(x) > 0 \} \setminus \bigcup_j \tilde B_j \right) = 0\).
\end{proof}
